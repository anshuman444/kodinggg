# Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return *the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal*.

In one move, you can increment `n - 1` elements of the array by `1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 0

```

 

**Constraints:**

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

    def minMoves(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        min_val = min(nums)
        return sum(x - min_val for x in nums)
```
